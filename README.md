# n8n-nodes-safeagent

**SafeAgent Execution Guard for n8n** — a limited free test node for claim-before-execute workflows.

SafeAgent suppresses repeated logical actions after a settled receipt. A `PENDING` claim is unresolved: it stays blocked and must be reconciled with the external provider before any retry. Local claim state alone does not prove the external outcome.

Claims an execution slot before an action, then routes to Proceed for a new claim or Skip for a repeated claim. A claim alone cannot guarantee an external action ran exactly once. Reconcile uncertain outcomes with the action provider before retrying.

Cited as a normative requirement in the A2A v0.4 RFC #1920 (https://github.com/a2aproject/A2A/discussions/1920) - part of a four-implementation, byte-verifiable execution safety stack, 11/11 cross-implementation conformance vectors byte-identical.

## Free tier only - please read

This node talks HTTP to SafeAgent's hosted API and only calls the **free test endpoint**
(`POST /claim/test`), which is rate-limited to 10 calls per IP address, total, with no
payment required. It does not store anything locally (earlier versions used a local
SQLite file - that has been removed).

Why only the free tier: SafeAgent's paid, unlimited endpoint (`POST /claim`) is gated by
genuine on-chain x402 payment - each call needs a fresh EIP-3009-signed USDC authorization
from an EVM wallet, not a reusable API key. Bundling a wallet-signing library into this
package to support that would add a real runtime dependency, and n8n's Cloud verification
program does not allow verified community nodes to have any runtime dependencies. Keeping
this node free-tier-only and dependency-free keeps it eligible for verification and safe to
install.

For unlimited, paid, production usage, call SafeAgent's `POST /claim` endpoint directly
outside n8n - see the options under "Also available as" below.

## Installation

In your n8n instance go to Settings -> Community Nodes -> Install and enter:

n8n-nodes-safeagent

Or install manually:

npm install n8n-nodes-safeagent

## How it works

State machine: PENDING -> COMMITTED | SKIP

Before any irreversible action - a Stripe charge, an outbound email, a trade, a webhook handler - the node claims an (Agent ID, Action Type, Scope) triple against SafeAgent's hosted API:

PROCEED - New claim, first time seeing this key. Run your action, then call Settle.
SKIP - Already seen (COMMITTED or still PENDING). If COMMITTED, the cached result comes back in `existing` - do not re-execute.

If the workflow crashes between Claim and Settle, the claim stays PENDING. A repeat is blocked; check the external provider for the action outcome and reconcile the claim before any retry.

---

## Operations

### Claim

Calls `POST /claim/test` with your Agent ID, Action Type, and Scope, which SafeAgent combines server-side into a content-addressed request ID. Returns PROCEED on first call, SKIP on any repeat with the same combination.

### Settle

Calls `POST /settle/{request_id}` to mark a previously claimed request as committed, with its result. Call this after the action succeeds in your Proceed branch.

---

## Quick test

Build a workflow with three nodes:

[Manual Trigger] -> [SafeAgent Guard (Claim)] -> PROCEED -> [your action] -> [SafeAgent Guard (Settle)]
-> SKIP -> [No Operation]

1. Set Agent ID to a fixed value, e.g. my-agent.
2. Set Action Type to a label, e.g. send_email.
3. Set Scope to something unique per logical request, e.g. customer:123.
4. Execute the workflow - item exits PROCEED.
5. Execute again with the same Agent ID / Action Type / Scope - item exits SKIP.

---

## Node parameters

Operation - claim or settle - default: claim
Base URL - SafeAgent API base URL - default: https://safeagent-production.up.railway.app (override only for a self-hosted instance)

Claim:
Agent ID - identifier for the agent or workflow performing the action
Action Type - short label for the action being guarded (e.g. send_email, payment.send)
Scope - everything that makes this execution unique (e.g. customer ID, order ID, timestamp/bar)

Settle:
Request ID - the request_id returned by a previous Claim call
Result - arbitrary JSON to store against this claim once settled

---

## Output fields

Claim -> PROCEED:
{ "status": "PROCEED", "request_id": "...", "test": true, "calls_remaining": 9 }

Claim -> SKIP:
{ "status": "SKIP", "request_id": "...", "test": true, "calls_remaining": 8, "existing": {} }

Settle:
{ "status": "committed", "request_id": "..." }

## Common use cases

Stripe node times out, n8n retries -> Customer charged twice -> With SafeAgent: SKIP on second call
Webhook delivered twice (Stripe/GitHub/Twilio at-least-once) -> Event processed twice -> With SafeAgent: SKIP on second call
Email node retried after transient error -> Duplicate email sent -> With SafeAgent: SKIP on second call
AI agent tool call retried after crash -> Duplicate side effect -> With SafeAgent: SKIP on second call

For webhook deduplication, use the provider event ID (e.g. Stripe event.id) as the Scope - it is stable across retries.

Remember: this node's free tier is limited to 10 total calls per IP address. For real production volume, use one of the options below instead of this node.
